Video Stenography

This is my dissertantion for the Third year university project
I am using Video LSB stenogrphy to hide audio dat.
The aims of this project are to:
- create a user firenly interface that accepts a video and audio input from the user
- Convert the audio input into digital audio
- Encrypt the digital audio data
- Store the audio in the video using LSB stenography
- Be able to transfer that video to another device and extract that encrypted data
- Unencrypt and restore the audio to its orginal form using the key

This project is designed to be used to avoid certain censorship controls. Where an audio, text or video file on its own may be suspishious I will use this to hide the data making it less detectable.
